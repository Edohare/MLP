Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

This is my machine learning portfolio, it is broken into supervised and unsupervised(coming soon) learning folders. I also included a data engineering group project that I led from my bachelor's degree.

Projects will be added over time as I learn new things. The order is based on most recent upload, so the higher the number, the more recent of an upload.

These projects will not always be perfected, they are about learning and showing different techniques. Alot of the projects are from courses that I take in order to teach myself and continue learning.
