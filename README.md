Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

This is my machine learning portfolio, it is broken into supervised and unsupervised(coming soon) learning folders. I also included a data engineering group project that I led from my bachelor's degree.

Projects will be added over time as I learn new things.

These projects will not always be perfected, they are about learning and showing different techniques.
